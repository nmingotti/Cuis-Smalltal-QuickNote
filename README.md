# Cuis-Smalltalk-QuickNote
Tool to take notes and in particular:
1. To write packages documentation
2. To copy snippets from/to the Wrokspace when we expect the system can boom!

This is a work in progress. This package is the best way I could figure
out to bend **StyledText** into my needs.

I need to write in monospace and be able to have colored font, 
highlight, bold and underline. 

## Start up 

Download or clone the package into the directory containing **Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev** directory, then 
run Cuis, open a Workspace and type this: 

```
Feature require: 'QuickNote'. 

# open a QuickNote document
QuickNote open. 
```
