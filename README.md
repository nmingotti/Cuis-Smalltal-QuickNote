# Cuis-Smalltalk-QuickNote
Tool to take notes and, in particular, to write packages documentation

This is a work in progress. This package is the best way I could figure
out to bend **StyledText** into my needs.

I need to write in monospace and be able to have colored font, 
highlight, bold and underline.
